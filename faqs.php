		<p> How does the Pick-A-Pics' Booth work? </p>
		<p> Get into the front of the booth - as many as you can. Our backdrop size is 5 ft. by 7 ft. When the technician starts the photo session, this is your time to shine! And as you exit the photobooth, the photos are produced in your customized 4" x 6" print layout in about 10 seconds. Then repeat as desired.</p>
