		<p>50% down payment is needed upon booking of the Photobooth, this confirms your reservation of the booth. The balance is due on the day of the event. Please settle the balance before the operation starts, especially if the Photo booth operation ends earlier than your party's duration, this means you wouldn't have to worry about anything else throughout your party.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="terms_booth">
		<p>We will set up the booth one hour before the start of the event, and will immediately disassemble it after the operation. The client will be notified 30 minutes prior to the disassembly. As much as possible, please allot a space for the photobooth indoors, weather conditions such as the tremendous heat, rain or strong winds can affect the operations (backdrop falling due to strong winds, equipment overheating because of the heat, etc.) Please provide 2 tables for the props and printouts as well.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="terms_cancel">
		<p>If you would like to cancel your booking, please remind us 5 days before the event. But Once you've placed a deposit for your booking, that date is already blocked off from other reservations. Therefore, the reservation fee will not be refundable if you cancel your booking later on. We would acknowledge rescheduling of the event with reference to the availability of the booth and within 2 months from the original date.</p>

	<div class="terms_obligation">
		<p>Props will be provided for your free usage but we expect that you handle them carefully. Any damage to the Photobooth and/or the props shall be charged accordingly. On the other hand, we will make sure operations flow smoothly for the duration of your rental. Keep in mind that the Photobooth is only a machine, in the event that a problem occurs during the operation, we will be willing to give you a refund with reference to the amount of service rendered and compromised. Meanwhile, refund shall not be granted for incidents other than fault on our end, such as power failure and equipment failure due to unruly crowd, etc.</p>
